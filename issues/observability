## Objective
What question should telemetry answer? (reliability, performance, usage, cost)

---

## Signals Needed
- **Metrics:** name(s), unit, type (counter/gauge/histogram), labels/tags (keep cardinality low)
- **Logs:** schema/fields, severity, sampling/retention
- **Traces:** spans, attributes, propagation, sampling rate
- **Events:** schema, volume expectations

---

## Scope & Sources
Components/services affected, boundaries, dependency visibility.

---

## SLOs & Alerts
- SLIs/SLO targets (e.g., availability, latency, error rate)
- Alert rules, thresholds, paging policy, runbooks

---

## Privacy & Compliance
PII/PHI presence, redaction policy, data retention, access controls.

---

## Cost Considerations
Sampling strategy, aggregation/windowing, storage retention.

---

## Dashboards & Ownership
Dashboards to create/update, team owner, on-call rotation link.
